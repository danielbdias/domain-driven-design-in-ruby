# Domain Driven Design code in Ruby

This repo has a proposal on how we could adapt some of DDD concepts into a RoR code. You can see the code on [app/business](https://github.com/danielbdias/domain-driven-design-in-ruby/tree/master/app/business) folder.

Heavily inspired on the model made while I worked with @williamweckl at RD Station.
